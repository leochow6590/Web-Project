		<h1 class="sectionHeadings">Overview</h1>
		<p>For this programming project, you are going to implement a web proxy server. This proxy server gets
			request messages from clients (web browsers), forwards the requests to target web server or another
			proxy server, obtains the corresponding response messages and sends the responses back to the clients.
			This proxy server should be able to handle all kinds of objects, not just HTML pages, but also images and
			audio files. Moreover, this proxy server should support persistent connections; a timeout timer should be
			used to terminate idle connection from client. To reduce the complexity of this programming project, the
			proxy server does not support caching mechanism.</p>

	<section id="Objectives">
		<h1 class="sectionHeadings">Objectives</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Through this exercise, you should get a solid understanding of how the text-based networking
				protocol (such as HTTP) works as well as how to implement a standard networking protocol.</li>
			<li>This is a good opportunity to further enhance your Socket programming skill in C/C++ .</li>
			<li>A learning and assessment activity to support ILO2d and ILO4.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<section id="Background">
		<h1 class="sectionHeadings">Background</h1>
		<p>HTTP is the transfer protocol used throughout the WWW. The HTTP protocol is a request/response
			protocol. When a client opens a connection, it immediately sends its request for a file. The web server
			then responds with the file or an error message. Each interaction consists of one request and one reply.
			Both are MIME-like message (MIME: The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).</p>
		<p>Each request message includes a request line, a few header lines, a blank line, and the possible message
			body. Similar is the response message.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Request-message = request-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [ message-body ]</li>
			<li>Response-message = status-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [ message-body ]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example, here are the request/response messages sent by a web client (wget) to the server to download a web document:</p>
		<div id="get"><img src="get.png"></div>
		<div id="response"><img src="response.png"></div>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">Non-Persistent Connection and Persistent Connection</h2>
		<p>In HTTP 1.0, after the TCP connection was established, a single request was sent over and a single response was sent back. Then the TCP connection was released. Establishing a separate connection for each file request incurs expensive
			overhead. In view of this deficiency, HTTP 1.1 was designed to support persistent connections. In HTTP 1.1, it is possible to establish a TCP connection, sends a request and gets a response, and then sends additional requests and gets
			additional responses. Our proxy server should support persistent connections between web clients and itself as well as between itself and target web/proxy servers.</p>
		<p>If an HTTP 1.1 client sends multiple requests through a single connection, the server should send responses back in the same order as the requests – this is all it takes for a server to support persistent connections. The server should close
			a
			connection after the connection has been idle for long enough duration (not defined in the specification; usually set to 10 – 15 seconds).</p>
	</section>
	<section id="Requirements">
		<h1 class="sectionHeadings">Requirements</h1>
		<p>You are going to write a simple concurrent HTTP proxy server (http_proxy) using C socket, which works as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The http_proxy server listens for connection requests from clients.</li>
			<li>When there is a new TCP connection request, the http_proxy server creates a new process** to handle the new connection.</li>
			<li>The new process sends any HTTP requests to the (origin/proxy) server and reads the server's reply.</li>
			<li>Then it sends the responses back to the requesting client.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>** Instead of using multiple processes, you can implement a multiple threads proxy server; the http_proxy server creates one new thread to handle each connection.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">Relay client requests and server responses</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Directly connect to target web (origin) server:
				<ul>
					<li>Extract the “Host: ” header line from the client request message to get the target server name</li>
					<li>Connect and send the request to target server on port 80</li>
					<li>Get the response and send back to client</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When configured to connect to another proxy server
				<ul>
					<li>Connect and send the request to the specified proxy server and port</li>
					<li>Get the response and send back to client</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">Persistent connections</h2>
		<p>With persistent connection, the proxy server leaves the connection open for serving more requests after handling a request. The server closes the connection as per the client instructs or if the timeout of idle connection has been reached.
			In
			order to let the client knows when is the end of a response message, all response messages on the persistent connection must have a self-defined message length using the Content-Length header field [except for the cases of dynamically
			generated
			web contents]. As our proxy server, in principle, is just a relay server, our proxy server does not need to handle that as the Content-Length headers should be generated by the origin servers.</p>
		<p>To terminate an idle client connection, the proxy server can simply close the TCP connection and the client browser should detect this situation automatically. Similarly, a client browser can terminate an idle persistent connection by
			closing
			the TCP connection; the proxy server should detect this situation and should handle this correctly.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">Support request types</h2>
		<p>For this programming project, HTTP requests generated by all test cases are GET request types. However, of unknown reasons, some browsers may generate POST requests under some situations (e.g., Chrome browser).</p>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">Caching proxy server</h2>
		<p>You are not required to implement the caching mechanism in this project. That means all requests received from the clients are forwarded to the target origin/proxy server without the needs to search the cache memory as well as manage the
			cache
			memory.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">How to start the HTTP proxy process</h2>
		<p>The http_proxy should be invoked as follow:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="sample">./http_proxy myport [proxy_server:port]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The 1st parameter – myport is the port number that the http_proxy is listening on. The 2nd parameter – proxy_server:port is an optional argument. When proxy_server:port is specified, all the HTTP requests (responses) should be forwarded to
			(received from) proxy_server. The port in proxy_server:port is the port number that the proxy_server is listening on.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionSubHeadings">Output messages</h2>
		<p>To aid your programming and debugging, please print some log information to the screen. You are required to generate some output with major events:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When receiving a new connection – identify the origin – display some useful information.</li>
			<li>When establishing a new connection – display the target server information</li>
			<li>When receiving a new request – display some information, e.g,, the request-line.</li>
			<li>When receiving a response message – display some information, e.g., message size</li>
			<li>When detecting the termination of persistent connections or server connection.</li>
		</ul>
